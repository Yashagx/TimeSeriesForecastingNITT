The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine NDV-HXP-S can be administered live intranasally (IN) and thus induce protective immunity in the upper respiratory tract.

The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a significant threat to public health. Besides humans, SARS-CoV-2 can infect several animal species. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic reagents and assays are urgently needed for rapid detection and implementation of strategies for prevention and control of the infection in animals.

Development of monoclonal antibody-based blocking ELISA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 exposure in animals,"ABSTRACT

The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a significant threat to public health. Besides humans, SARS-CoV-2 can infect several animal species. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic reagents and assays are urgently needed for rapid detection and implementation of strategies for prevention and control of the infection in animals. In this study, we initially developed a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid",COVID19,ChezProvence,2023-07-11 06:00:34,https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00067-23,4,1
